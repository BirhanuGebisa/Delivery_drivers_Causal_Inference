## Introduction

> This week's challenge task interim report focuses on causal inference using real-world Nigeria
Gokada delivery driver service data. Gokada is one of the largest last-mile delivery services in
Nigeria.

## Overview

> Current business challenges center on the causal inference of our client Gokada, Nigeria's largest
last-mile delivery service. Gokada Works is partnered with motorbike owners and drivers to
deliver parcels across Lagos, Nigeria. Gokada has completed more than a million deliveries in
less than a year with a fleet of over 1200 riders. One key issue Gokada has faced as it expands its
service is the suboptimal placement of pilots (Gokada calls their motor drivers pilots) and clients
who want to use Gokada to send their parcels. As a result, a large number of delivery requests
have gone unfulfilled.



## Objective

> This objective of this project is very straightforward: design and build a robust, reliable, large-scale It is working on its data to help it understand the primary causes of
unfulfilled requests, as well as come up with solutions that recommend driver locations that
increase the fraction of complete orders. Since drivers are paid based on the number of requests
they accept, this solution will help Gokada business grow both in terms of client satisfaction and
increased business volume.

## Data

There are two datasets available for this project.


The first one is the table that contains information about the completed orders
>   Column             Non-Null Count   Dtype 
---  ------            --------------   ----- 
 > 0   Trip ID           536020 non-null  int64 
 > 1   Trip Origin       536020 non-null  address
 > 2   Trip Destination  536020 non-null  address
 > 3   Trip Start Time   534369 non-null  timestamp
 > 4   Trip End Time     536019 non-null  timestamp
 
The second one is the table that contains delivery requests by clients (completed and unfulfilled) 
>   Column         Non-Null Count    Dtype  
---  ------         --------------    -----  
> 0   id                1557740 non-null  int64  
> 1   order_id          1557740 non-null  int64  
> 2   driver_id         1557740 non-null  int64  
> 3   driver_action     1557740 non-null  object 
> 4   lat               1557740 non-null  float64
> 5   lng               1557740 non-null  float64
> 6   created_at        0 non-null        float64
> 7   updated_at        0 non-null        float64
